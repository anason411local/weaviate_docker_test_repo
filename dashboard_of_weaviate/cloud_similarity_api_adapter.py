"""
To apply this middleware to your existing Weaviate dashboard application:

1. Import the middleware in your new_dashboard.py:
   ```python
   from cloud_similarity_api_adapter import apply_middleware_to_app
   ```

2. Before starting the app, apply the middleware:
   ```python
   # After creating your app but before running it
   app = FastAPI(...)
   
   # Apply middleware
   app = apply_middleware_to_app(app)
   
   # Then run the app
   ```

3. This will automatically adjust all similarity scores to be more cloud-like
   without having to modify your vector database or individual API endpoints.
