Okay. In fact, you remind me of the uh uh uh uh another business owner whom I spoke with that was uh a year ago. I think that was back in November. Okay? And he's actually a uh a home improvement company, okay? I think that was I uh yeah, as far as I can remember, he was actually based in Texas. And he was also um kind of skeptical about moving forward with us because he also had a bad experience. Okay? Uh-huh. But once I was able to persuade him to sign up, okay, he was actually very happy. In fact, uh a couple of months after, that was December, he called me and he actually was very, very thankful and and he said, "Thank you," because uh I was able to persuade him because once he did, it actually made an impact to him financially. He was able to grow his business. He was able to get uh get his employees busy with all those all those work that they are getting. Okay? And that's the exact same thing I want to show you right now, Dan.
Beep.
