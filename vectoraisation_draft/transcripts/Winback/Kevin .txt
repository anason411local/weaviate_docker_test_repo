Uh uh but Winter Haven, yes, it's going to be active. It has to be active, and that

It has to be active. Okay. Uh here's the thing, sir. If you wanted uh I I'll give you one option then.

If you wanted, you don't need to open the uh uh the AdWords campaign in in Lake Wales first. We'll focus on your local listing in that location, and I will give you specific discount on that account so that you will not be charged more than $200 or more than $300 on those uh marketing campaign including with Winter Haven, okay?

In Winter Haven, as of the moment, sir, yes, you have a balance of 2 months. But I will give you a discount, and I will cover all the late fees on that account then for you.

Okay?

Now, your Google AdWords, that's $600, sir, by the way. I'll explain it to you. That $600 is the other campaign that you have in Winter Haven for uh the the the the Google AdWords account.

Okay?

If you cannot cover at least 1 month payment uh for the local listing or local SEO that you have, you can actually uh cover at least a partial payment on that so that I can fully reactivate all the services that you have in Winter Haven.

And for for Lake Wales, sir, you don't need to activate an AdWords there. All we need to cover there is your local listing and the call screening. That's it.

No, we don't We don't need to do anything from Lake Wales. I told everybody I don't I told I speak almost 40, 60 person in your side, and I told I don't want it no more. And then

Okay. You really don't want the Lake Wales?

No. No. No.

Okay, then. No problem. Let's go ahead and uh let's uh I'll go ahead and activate only the the Winter Haven account that you have then. And uh I will not activate any other accounts. This is the only account that we'll be working for you then, okay?

Lake Wales, Lakeland, and other uh uh Lake Wales and Lakeland that you have before, I will not reactivate. The only account that we need to make sure being reactivated, everything, is Winter Haven account, correct?

Yeah.

Okay.

One second, sir. I'll go ahead and reactivate uh those account then. And by the way, sir, for your Google listing, call screening service and activated for your marketing campaign in Winter Haven, um I'll waive the late fees for you, and I will cover a percentage of the balance on that account that you have then, okay?

All right. So, how much is going to be?

Okay. So, the total balance that you have here is going to be 1 second. Because it's been 2 months, so we did not receive a payment. I'll add this one then. Hold on a sec, sir. Because I will remove the late fees on this account. One second.

So, A&E Irrigation. Hold on.

Okay.

So, sir, the total balance that you have for 2 months actually is at $572. But I will take care of the uh I'll take care of the percentage and uh waive the late fees for it. So, the only thing that you need to cover in total for that account is $382.

If you can do the full payment of $382.67, sir, then uh $382, sorry, then you can make a partial payment for it today.

And it will be fully reactivated. If you can cover the $382 right now, it would be best because I can waive off the late fees, everything, directly for today then.
