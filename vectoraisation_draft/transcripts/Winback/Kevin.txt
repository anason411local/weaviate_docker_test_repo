Hello?
Uh hello there, Mr. Ibrahim?
Yes.
Okay. Give me a second. Uh sir, sorry for the long wait earlier, okay? Uh I uh I had a conversation actually with the uh with the account manager. And uh I am No problem, no. Okay. doing something for the balance on the account, especially that uh the request that you did wasn't uh wasn't done accordingly when you when you re-establish your account with us. So that's what I'm using right now, sir, so that I can do something for it. And uh because basically if there is already a balance, it needs to be settled. You understand that, right? What I'm doing right now is I'm making them an arrangement so that we can process the setup fee or at least waive some uh some even the late fees or whatever fees that is showing on the account. Okay? So right now The problem now is Ah, okay. Yep. But right now, the address, the the the name of the company and the new industry that you have, our technician already confirmed that we can verify that as long as the account is already been reactivated with us. Okay? So I just need to make sure how much we need to pay in order for us to settle actually the balance or or or we just need to process the activation fee then. Okay? Hold on a sec. But how I pay you without activated? It's It's didn't recognize from from 6 months ago, didn't recognize. How I pay pay pay every month without recognize? Google doesn't know my company. 6 months I paid paid paid without recognized. I I understand what you're trying to to to tell me, sir. That's the reason why again, as mentioned to you, as we're uh reviewing on the account, sir, because if you notice here on my end, okay? Uh if you notice on my end, sir, the account that you have with us for Cross Heating and Air Conditioning, you just recently reactivated it on the month of June, correct? Okay. Okay. Now on the month of June, sir, when you started your campaign with us, the address that you provided is in 404 Rosedale Avenue in La Puente, California, 91744. Okay. But it is recognized too. It's didn't recognize too. That's right, sir. Now the main issue there is you mentioned that in terms of activation on the account, the problem that you have is you cannot do the video verification. Correct? You're having trouble uh trouble with the video verification, correct? Yeah. Yes. That's right, sir. Now, that's the reason why there are particular address actually, sir, that we really need to do a video verification, especially if you're not staying there completely, okay? Now when I double check it with our technicians, okay, right now, the new address that you provided which is in West uh West Covina in California, we can request for a manual verification there. No need for you to do a video verification. Okay? But Okay. the reason why the balance there is showing is because you agreed the first time that you can do a video verification with the address in La Puente, California, sir. I hope you understand that. Uh that's the reason why you're paying to it. And the best thing that I can do is I can take care of the late fees as a courtesy for you. But since there is already a balance showing on the account, sir, I really can't do anything not unless we get the special approval. Or hold on a sec. Give me a second, okay? Okay. Um one sec. This is 121.99. Done. So this one is taken care of. Okay. Hold on, sir. I'm reviewing it for you. Okay. So that means to say, sir, that the total balance on the account uh right now since it's been 2 months that we did not receive a payment, less the late fees, the cancellation fee and everything, it will still be at least $243.98 in total. That's 2 months balance, sir. No, I started again. I I will not pay anything like that. I will start again. I I paid paid paid without recognize. I will start again. Why How to pay late fees? How? How I start from scratch again? And I lost all the 6 months I paid without any reason, without any reason. Paid paid paid without any reason. How I pay again? Here's the thing, sir. Okay? Uh here's here's the thing, sir. Not only the website, sir, if you're going to talk about it with Google, if you're going to search, you can see their links already because if your listing is not verified, sir, we're not going to stop from there. We are also going to create an organic listing for your account. Okay? Try to search actually for refrigerator repair service, and this is the thing, sir, okay? There is a mistake already that you provided as well with our technician because what your business is doing is for air conditioning. The one that you provided for the industry is refrigerator service. That is a huge different That is a two different services, sir. We can add as an additional service for refrigerator uh refrigeration repair service, but if your main money maker is for air conditioning service, then the main uh the then the the main industry that you should be focusing on is with your HVAC contractors. It will focus for installation, for repairs, for maintenance, and we can add additional service for refrigeration repair. Now I will try to do this, okay? I will try to do this, sir, with our accounting. Give me 1 second. Instead of the 243.99, I will try to tell them that we will cover the 50%, which is uh 121.99 on that, okay? And you don't need to pay that upfront. What we can do is we can do it in the two payments then for you. Let's say we we will cover uh we will cover $60 today, and uh at the end of the month, $60 then. And the rest will be taken care of. If you will agree with that, I will speak to them again, and I will get them uh uh I will get an approval from them on that. What do you think? Instead of 40 40 uh for today at the end of the month, we will do is we will cover $60 today at the end of the month, $60, and it will cover actually the 2 months balance that you have. It will refresh everything. $60 for today and $60 at the end of the month for the previous balance on the account. No, no, it's not activated. I will not pay this money now. It's not I paid 6 months ago, and I didn't I didn't work anything, just pay and in the end of the day, they closed my account. I paid paid paid, and after that, closed my account. I paid and closed my Why I closed my account? It's not my fault. I What is this? I pay pay pay pay without anything. I didn't think it will work. That means to say that as of the moment, what you're willing to pay for the previous balance is just $40 today and $40 at the end of the month. The rest, you're not going to pay the other balances. Yes. Hold on a second, sir. But But you are You talk with me, right? For I I have to put the my air conditioning contractor first, and the second, refrigeration. You are right. For I told I told them many many times this idea. I told them second, something I make refrigeration, but the main work is They told me, "Yes, yes, yes," without do anything. This right talking. So that means to say you also suggested you also uh the one that I mentioned to you today, the one to to to fix the issue that you have, changing the industry to HVAC contractor, and they say we can just leave it as it is? What? Uh you mentioned that the previous agent that you spoke to, they just said that the industry that you have is just right. We can just leave it as it is? No, I Yeah, he told me I will I told him like you now, like you told me. I told him make the air conditioning this main my work. The main work is this air conditioning, HVAC. And second work, refrigeration. They told me, "Okay, yes, yes, you are right, you are right," and nobody did anything. For I I don't work uh refrigeration, the main work. The main work is the air conditioning. And they didn't change the industry for it? Yes, yes, didn't change. This I told them many many times this. You are right talking to be the first one is air conditioning. Okay, hold on. Okay. Be sure in the first work, air conditioning. Be sure. It will be, sir. I am the one who advised it to you. That's the reason why actually I I uh That's the reason why, sir, I asked you those questions actually earlier so that I'll understand what's really the market and the the listing that you're looking for. There's a huge actually uh There's actually a huge mistake or misinformation already on your account. The refrigerator repair service is not the main business that you do. As we're checking with the industry or the advertising uh the the the services that you have, you do air conditioning maintenance, central air conditioning. You do also repair and installation. Those are not refrigerator repair service. Those are HVAC contractor services. So that's why I advised you, we need to update the industry that you have, and refrigerator repair service, we can just add it to the website that that is an additional service that you do. Okay? We can do that. So that we can get the right market for the account. The money maker that you do will still be air conditioning for both residential and commercial service. Also, instead of using the La Puente, California, since the address that you'd like to be visible is in West Covina, California, this shouldn't be the case in the first place that you started with us. So we are going to update the address for you for Cross Heating and Air Conditioning to the address that you provided, which is in 2921 East Level Glen Drive in West Covina, California, 91792. Okay? Yes. Yes. Um right now, I'm getting and uh I I I'm I'm I'm checking what I can do actually for you because Okay. because I need to to have an approval. I hope you understand, sir. I'm good in advertising, I'm good in everything, but I'm not accounting department, okay? I need to discuss it with them so that we can get an approval. And if they would agree actually with what you mentioned that you will get $40 today and $40 the end of the month, and you will pay the monthly fee right after, but not the not the previous balance, correct? Once this one is fixed. Yes, but I I pay you after I pay after activate, after Google knows me. For still, I didn't fix the business. No, no, I You don't need to worry. No need for you to worry on that, sir. I am the one handling your account. I know that it will be fixed. So if if if there is a verified listing in West Covina, California, you're going to pay the monthly recurring fee of the account, correct? I just need to have a confirmation. Okay, then. Give me a second, sir. I will work with it. Please do not hang up right now. It's very I will not hang up. You hung it up. Yes, okay. Okay, then. I'll just stay on the line, okay? And um uh maybe you'll be uh hearing like uh a a hold music, but just stay on the line, sir, okay? One second. Sure. Okay. Sure. [Hold music]
