The leads for the auto repair goes to this phone number.
The one for the bubble truck goes to the 754. I keep telling you guys that. But you still keep doing it wrong.

One moment, please. Okay. So, let me just talk about for the HR, uh, Mobile Auto Repair LLC. Is this the number, the one that you are using right now, and they keep sending to?
Yes. That's the number that all the calls need to be coming to and all the text messages.
Okay. Except for the one in Bubble Truck, it should be the one ending 3604, correct?
Yes. And also, yep, that's correct. Also, the page for the bubble truck, right?

Since you've mentioned, the last time that we've talked, you've mentioned about the Naples, something area. But to be honest, I'm not seeing any Naples at all that was being set up in your account.
