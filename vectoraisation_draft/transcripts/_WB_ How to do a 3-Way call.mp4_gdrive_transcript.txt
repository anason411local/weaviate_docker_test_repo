we're going to show you how to do a three-way call in sales we use it when for example a customer is using a credit card that is not under their name but then there's somebody else's name and as we all know we need to read the verification script on that person that owns the credit card so you can use that in these scenarios another example would be when the customer says you know what call me back I got to talk to my partner I got to talk to my wife and cetera all you have to say is sure let me get them on the line I want to make sure I address all the questions they have so you can guys make an educated decision was their phone number and that was three-way call and customer service you know more specific cases obviously all of these cases apply but other specific cases would be when the customer says for example I want to use my domain name but I don't know how to get the username and the password or I used to be with another SEO company they all my username and passwords whenever solving customer's problems or trying to retain the customer that you want to use a three-way call it's a very few very simple steps number one transfer click on transfer conference number two step number two is play the checkbox on dial override make sure you don't touch anything in this area Here Local closer the drop down so just that over right and then type in the phone number to the customer service and then with the customer make sure you do that with the customer this way you are on a three-way call with a customer yourself and the third party whatever that is if that's going to be the SEO company that has to use them in the password to the listing so we can get in 0.008 company that can give us access to the domain so we can use it for the website whether that's going to be the person whose credit card we're going to use to set up or to collect the balance or that's going to be the partner that the customer wants to discuss with before signing up with us now one more important item whenever you dial a party or the third person sometimes there could be an AVR ivr is whenever they ask you first one to do this press two to do that and said Etc so you can press 1 2 3 whatever you need to press two ways number one you can pull up your boyfriend and go on the dial pad and click the number you want to press the other way is to put the number here in DTMF and type in the number two and send Etc so these are two options to buy an ivr and this is how you dial a customer if for some reason the other line is not picking up you want to hang up and do it again everybody already knows hang up on transfer line and do the fastest one more time thank you very much for watching that's useful bye
