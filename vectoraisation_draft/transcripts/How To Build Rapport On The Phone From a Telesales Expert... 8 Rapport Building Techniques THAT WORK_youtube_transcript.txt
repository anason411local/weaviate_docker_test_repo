my daughter is amazing a building
rapport with people over the phone and
so I've asked her to share eight power
tips with you that will definitely
enable you to close more deals plus
you've got to check out the bloopers
that I've added at the end so today I'm
here to share with you eight quick tips
that I feel will really help you when
building rapport over the phone the
first of these is to have a plan it's
really important going into a phone call
to have a clear objective so you know
what you're getting out of it now I
would suggest writing down a sentence or
two summarizing your objective so that
the phone call can't go too far off
track next ask them how they are and
really mean it this one sounds a bit
ridiculous but it's so so important that
you can get on the same page with the
person you're speaking with as soon as
possible and asking how they are and
showing a genuine interest will make all
the difference next write down key
points now this is probably my favorite
and the most useful of all of these tips
you have to have a pen and paper ready
when going into a conversation with
someone over the phone for example they
may mention something that to them might
feel completely insignificant at the
beginning of the conversation but if
you've made a note of that and bring
that up later on the rapport that you
two will have will be so much better
you've got to ask open questions it's so
important there's always going to be a
temptation to ask questions which
warrant just one worded answers but if
you're really going to learn something
from the other person you have to ask
questions which allow them to talk and
allow you to listen don't be afraid to
use the power of silence this will take
some getting used to but it's such a
great tool in getting the other party to
open up people don't like silence so the
less you're speaking the more they'll
feel inclined to talk and therefore the
more you can gain out of the
conversation I've called this one what
else or can you tell me more the purpose
of this tip is to extract more
information from them and not accept
their first answer so by asking what
else or asking them to give you more
information it forces them to be the one
that's speaking and fill that silence my
seventh tip is summarizing back this is
where the pen and paper
we'll come in handy it's really
important throughout the cool you pause
and summarize back what you've already
learnt so it shows the other person that
you've been listening and we'll build
massive amounts of rapport it will also
help you make sure that you've caught
everything and not missed any
information my last tip is to help you
find an organic flow to your
conversation so many people go into
these phone calls with preconceived
notions about where that's going to end
up but that can really damage the
rapport that you've got with the other
person it's important to slow down
really take your time and allow the
conversation to take its own course
because it may end up somewhere even
better than you'd originally expected
just for a giggle how do I start it you
must ask every time I gates it's always
like huh
the faster next or I made a weird noise
morning I've got a Sula Sula sweaty up a
little bit like it I can't smile okay
we're gonna have to redo all of these
because I look okay
