You know, you actually, you know, I just remembered my customer four months ago, right? He is actually a plumber. Okay? He, I mean, he's just like you. Okay? He said he doesn't trust me. It's the first time that we've talked. And then he told me, "You know what, Mavis? I'm gonna bring, I'm closing down my business because I'm not getting enough customers and I don't want to do this." Okay? Now, I I told him, you know, "Just give me a shot. Give me 60 days to prove to you what we can do for your business." You know, within 30 days, Benjamin, he got one customer. Okay? He called me back. He tell, he told me, "Thank you. You gave me one customer." Unfortunately, he canceled. But do you know why he canceled? He canceled because that gave him a three-year contract for a plumbing service. And of course, I told him, "That's okay. That's fine. I'm not gonna push you to take all those customers that we can give you if you think you can't handle them. But it's a good thing that you got that one customer that can actually provide you and make sure that you're not closing down your business." Right?
Yeah.
Mhm.
Right. And you know, that day I realized for just one single phone call, okay, for just one single phone call, it made a difference. Right? And it it changed his life. He's about to, he's about to close down his business, but now he's doing his business. He's doing plumbing services and he has a three-year contract for it. And that's what I want for your business.
