I don't want to add cost anymore to what I'm already paying to keep my business afloat. I don't think advertising is necessary to my business right now. I'm earning quite well. I get enough jobs that I need.

Clarence, I understand you're happy with how your business is going. You get the jobs that you need and you only cover the right cost for your business, correct?

Yes, that's right. I'm doing good.

Well, Clarence, I had clients who was in a similar situation as you are now. He was quite happy of how his rent-a-car business was going. He got the jobs he needed and he didn't had to add cost to his business.

But somehow, he had this nagging thought that he wanted his business not just to sustain for himself, but also for his children. Something that he can leave them behind to continue even without him.

You mentioned to me earlier you had children. Does that mean anything to you, Clarence?

Tell me more. I'm listening.
