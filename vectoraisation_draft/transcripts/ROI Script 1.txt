Hey John, let me ask you this. How much on average do you make per job?

$300.

Okay. Now, if there are 200 searches for a plumber in your area and I put you in front of those 200 people, say 5% called you, how many do you think you could close?

Well, at least five, I think.

Okay. So let's do the math. That's five jobs closed at $300 per job. That makes $1,500 from the job that I sent you, which, John, more than covers for the cost of the service. And on top of that, the service also gives you a constant flow of new customers calling you every time they need something done. And that will definitely help your business, right?
