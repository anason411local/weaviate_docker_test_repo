I got I got more than I can handle. I don't I don't need to advertise.
You got more than you can handle and you're doing transmissions?
Last transmission guy that told me that, he, I mean, last guy that told me that, he did he didn't know what we were offering. So he said kind of close to the same thing. "I've been in business for a long time and I don't advertise." Well, to be honest with you, I've been, we've been doing automatic transmissions since they came out with automatic transmissions.
And that's something that you want to boast upon. That's something that you want people to know so that way you get more of those jobs. Let me ask you, what's your average transmission going? I know when I got mine redone, it cost me a lot of money.
Well, the average one on a Dodge, if you just go buy a rebuilt transmission, cost you about 30, 400 bucks. That's without labor putting it in. I did a whole job for about 25, 27.
See, that's that's why this is something that works so well for you. I don't have to sit here and tell you I'm going to bring you a million jobs for this to be something that's economically feasible for your business. Think about it. If I'm bringing you two to three more
To the point where I I only I only take in what I want to do.
Well, and here's the best part. I want you to only take on what you can. What I also want you to do is have a more qualified phone call. That means instead of getting a lot of phone calls where you're turning work down left and right, you're going to get phone calls that are for the particular jobs that you want to take on. So as opposed to just any old person calling you, you want people
How are you going to do this?
